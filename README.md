# TestingDrivenDevelopment

> *The last excercise within TOP's Computer Science module, the purpose was to solve a variation of the common **"Knights Tour"** problem. The intention is to demonstrate the shortest path necessitated to traverse from select starting to ending coordinates. This program utilises a **Breadth First Search Algorithm** within the realms of **Graph** data structures*.

## ABOUT

1. A *capitalize* function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
2. A *reverseString* function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. A *calculator* object that contains functions for the basic operations: **add**, **subtract**, **divide**, and **multiply**. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
4. A *caesarCipher* function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.
5. An *analyzeArray* function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: **average**, **min**, **max**, and **length**.
